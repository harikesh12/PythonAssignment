Postgres DB

1. Create a table (student) with 3 columns (rollno, name, course).

create table student (name text,roll_no int, course text);

2. Insert records for 4 students.

insert into student values ('Ram',1,'Java');
insert into student values ('Shyam',2,'Python'),('Ramesh',3,'JavaScript'),('Karan',4,'DB')

3. Write a Select query to fetch all the students.

select * from student

4. Update the student name of rollno 3 with ‘Mohan’

update student set name='Mohan' where roll_no=3

5. Delete any student from table with their rollno.

delete from student where roll_no=4

6. Delete all the data from student table.
 
delete from student

7. Drop the student table.

drop table student

8. Create Courses table (cid, cname) where cid is a primary key and Student table
(rollno, name, cid) where rollno is a primary key and cid is a foreign key.

create table course(cid int,cname text, primary key (cid))
create table student (roll_no int , name text, cid int, primary key (roll_no), constraint
					 fk_cid Foreign key (cid) references course(cid))

9. Insert data in both the tables.

insert into course values(101,'Java'),(102,'Python')
insert into student values(1,'Ram',101),(2,'Shyam',102),(3,'Ramesh',102)

10. Select all the students who are doing a specific course, eg. Python.

select name from student where cid = (select cid from course where cname='Python')  # just for one course ID of python
select name from student where cid in (select cid from course where cname='Python') # in case there are multiple course Id for python
